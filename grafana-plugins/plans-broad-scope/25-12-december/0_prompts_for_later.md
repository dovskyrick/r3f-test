i have a proposed solution for our problem of there not being a add cattegory. somehow you already have done a toggle which opens up more options once toggled. we can simply have a toggle called attitude visualization, that when made true opens all of the others that we have created so far, both sensor projections and celestial refrence grid. from my tests the definitions inside even persist the closing and opening of the master toggle . this is a solution and not bad UX since the master toggle isnt deactivating the other toggles without giving visual feedback to the user, the feedbak is all the other toggles disappearing and appearing with the master toggle. is this good for you ?
