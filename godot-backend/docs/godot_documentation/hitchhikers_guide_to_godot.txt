Hitchhiker's Guide to GODOT
############################

GODOT is a set of libraries which perform many tasks related to astrodynamics. There is a lot of it
and it can be disconcerting to new users.

:red:`Don’t panic!`

We have written an overview of the software  which will allow users to get their bearings. A hitchhiker’s
guide to GODOT if you like.

Starting from the GODOT root directory, notice the software is organized into several directories.

* **godot** contans all of the C++ stuff we wrote
* **pybind** contains the python interface libraries. We also wrote this.
* **ext** contains the third party software is collected here. This is code from external sources.

In this guide we will concentrate on the godot directory.

The godot directory contains three sub directories. We will discuss each of these in turn.

What's in a Library
-------------------

First a very quick look at what's in a library.

Each library folder contains source files, a tests directory and a Makefile. These make up a library. 

They are either compiled into a shared object library or, if they are a `template <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_%28C%2B%2B%29>`_ library of 
header only files, they make up a template library whose elements are included in other libraries' compiled code.

The tests directory contains at least a unit subdirectory which hosts the unit test programs for the library.
Sometimes there are other test directories e.g. comp or perf. The tests are run automatically on request as part of 
the build process.

The API (application programming interface) of each library is documented in the source files. This is then automatically converted using doxygen so that you can read it 
as part of this documentation. Look for the API entry in the contents.

Core Layer
----------

The core library folder contains many subdirectories. Each of these contains a library. 
The core libraries may depend on each other and on the third party libraries.

The core libraries do not have any particular coherent pattern. Each library implements an API which is peculiar to
that library, and the structure of the software is particular to each library.

* **Astro** Basic astrodynamics computation.
* **Atmos** Planetary atmospheres.
* **Autodif** Automatic differentiation, see :ref:`here <autodif_ug>`
* **Constants** Constants collection
* **Ephem** Planetary ephemeris access. Uses CALCEPH
* **Estim** SRIF estimation library, uses lapack and
* **Events** Event computation library, see :ref:`here <events_ug>`
* **Integ** Numerical integration of ODEs
* **Ipfwrap** Local wrapper for FD interpolation library.
* **Linalg** Linear algebra interface for EIGEN.
* **Num** Numerical utilities
* **Orient** Planet and Earth orientation.
* **Provider** File access library.
* **Query** Query library for database access.
* **Tempo** Time, see :ref:`here <tempo_ug>`
* **Typetraits** Basic definitions for template libraries
* **Util** A collection of useful utilities

There is a lot of stuff here. Some of these libraries have their own users' guide which you are encouraged to read. 
Others, although important, are intentionally hidden from the user. For some we will add documentation at a later date.

Model layer
-----------

The model subdirectory is where the modelling software lives. These libraries are used to perform specific 
computations needed for astrodynamics, e.g. dynamic models, orbit propagation, observation modelling, 
geometry modelling, reference frame computations.

* **Interface** The collection of interfaces implemented by the models
* **Common** Common functionality
* **Stations** Tracking station data book.
* **Spacecraft** Spacecraft data book
* **Dyn** Dynamics models
* **Frames** :ref:`Reference frames <frames_ug>`
* **Geometry** Geometry classes for events and propagation
* **Gravity** :ref:`Gravity computations <gravity_ug>`
* **Obs** :ref:`Observation models <obs_ug>`
* **Prop** :ref:`ODE solution propagation <propagator_ug>`

Model Based Programming
=======================

The main design feature about these libraries is that they implement specific interfaces so that they can 
make use of each other and applications can make use of them in a very flexible way.

This can be thought of as a kind of model based programming scheme. This means that typically, when you construct an object, instead of passing the values of the inputs you instead pass
an object (implementing a certain interface) which can be evaluated to get the input needed. 

The most common interface family is TimeEvaluable.

A TimeEvaluable class is one which implements `godot.model.interface.TimeEvaluableT<Size>`.
It can be ScalarTimeEvaluable or VectorTimeEvaluable. There are different types
for different dimension of Vector and Matrix TimeEvaluable (e.g. :py:class:`godot.model.interface.Vector3TimeEvaluable`).

What this means is simply that if a class implements the :py:class:`godot.model.interface.ScalarTimeEvaluable` it must 
have a pair of *eval* methods which take a time and returns a scalar.

.. code:: cpp

    double x = object.eval(epoch)

    autodif::xdouble x = object.eval(xepoch)

where *epoch* and *xepoch* are time objects with and without partial derivatives.

How does this bring flexibility? Suppose you are writing a :py:class:`godot.model.interface.ScalarTimeEvaluable` class 
which computes a simple area to mass ratio.

Lets demonstrate the example in C++:

.. code:: cpp

    class AreaToMassRatio : public godot::model::interface::ScalarTimeEvaluable
    {
    public:

        AreaToMassRatio ( double area, double mass ) :
        area_(area),
        mass_(mass)

        double eval(tempo::Epoch epoch){ return eval_impl(epoch );  }

        autodif::xdouble = object.eval(tempo::XEpoch epoch){ return eval_impl(epoch );  }

    private:

        template<typename S>
        S eval_impl(tempo::Epoch<S>)
        {
            return area_/mass_;
        }  

        double area_;
        double mass_;

    };

This fine, but suppose I wanted to change it so that the area was a function of time, e.g. a complex model based on 
several polygons spinning in space?

If I instead write

.. code:: cpp

    class AreaToMassRatio : public godot::model::interface::ScalarTimeEvaluable
    {
    public:
        AreaToMassRatio ( ScalarTimeEvaluablePtr area, ScalarTimeEvaluablePtr mass ) :
        area_(area),
        mass_(mass)

        double eval(tempo::Epoch epoch){ return eval_impl(epoch );  }

        autodif::xdouble = object.eval(tempo::XEpoch epoch){ return eval_impl(epoch );  }

    private:

        template<typename S>
        S eval_impl(tempo::Epoch<S>)
        {
            return area_->eval(epoch)/mass_->eval(epoch);
        }  

        ScalarTimeEvaluablePtr area_;
        ScalarTimeEvaluablePtr mass_;

    };

Now I can create a :py:class:`godot.model.interface.ScalarTimeEvaluable` for the area , for the mass and the ratio. 
I can use my :py:class:`godot.model.interface.ScalarTimeEvaluable` ratio class with a trivial constant area or a 
complex area based on polygons and a rotating body.

This means I can construct a more complex modelling by combining simpler models, and I can pass the final 
complex model to another class, e.g. passing the RHS of the ODE to the propagator, without having to evaluate 
any of the models in advance.

We have tried to made the use of the time evaluable interface somewhat easier using operators and overloading 
constructors of classes to allow time evaluables to be optionally constructed by the class which uses them.

.. code:: cpp

    godot::model::interface::ScalarTimeEvaluable s1; // ok you cant actually do this
    godot::model::interface::ScalarTimeEvaluable s2; // ditto
    double x=2;
    autodif::xdouble xx(1.0);

    res1 = s1 * x;
    res2 = s1 + s2;
    res3 = s1 + s2 * xx;

     
This is a simple example but imagine if the entire modelling system is written like this. It means that 
generalization of the modelling and ease of extension and adaptation is greatly facilitated.


Automatic differentiation and Parameters
========================================

We have seen that if a class implements the :py:class:`godot.model.interface.ScalarTimeEvaluable` it must 
have a pair of *eval* methods, one for linalg computations and one for autodif computations. 
From a user persective this means that the same objects and classes are used to do these different computations.

One feature which might seem a bit obscure to new users is how partial derivatives are computed. You can look all day in the code 
for partial derivative expressions, or numerical differentiation and find (almost) none. This is because the underlying mathematical operations themselves
take care of this. You should read more about it :ref:`here <autodif_ug>`, it is fundamental to the entire design.

Now, the objects which partial derivatives are computed with respect to are called leaves. Leaves are the final
parameters in an automatic differentiation tree. There are several types of leaves that can be used. Two of the
simplest are the :py:class:`godot.core.autodif.BasicLeaf` and :py:class:`godot.core.autodif.NamedLeaf`. Leaves are like an identifying
tag which is kept track of during the computations. Every time an autodif operation is evaluated, 
the chain rule is applied to update the partial derivatives of the output of the operation with respect to the leafs 
tracked by the inputs.

Now, we talked about model based programming concepts before. This means that all our modelling layer classes use as inputs (mostly) abstract things
known as `godot::model::interface::TimeEvaluableT<Size>`. The classes are templates and either autodif or linalg types and Eigen matrices of both, can be used
by all these classes. This means that we dont need to worry about what Parameters are right now. These we can define later, and as long as they are `godot::model::interface::TimeEvaluableT<Size>`
classes, which make use of autodif leaves, they will work just fine.


Frames
======

The other major aspect of the modelling which should be understood is the frames system. 
There is a specific :ref:`user’s guide to frames <frames_ug>`, but the general concept is explained here.

A frames object is a container to hold a collection of Points and Axes.

An Axes is a coordinate axes defined by a rotation transform with respect to another parent Axes. 
They form a tree with the root Axes the only one which does not have a parent. The root is usually the ICRF.

A Point is a point in space which is defined by a translation transform in a particular Axes with respect to 
a parent Point. They also form a tree with the parentless root usually being the SSB.

The rotation and transform classes implement :py:class:`godot.model.interface.Rotation` and :py:class:`godot.model.interface.Translation`
interfaces respectively, these are special types of time evaluable interface that handles time 
derivatives as well as autodif partial derivatives and which perform the computation in place rather than return results 
by value for efficiency.

The frames system is constructed using helper functions. The helper functions can construct frames from:

* An ephemeris file
* A station book
* An ipf orbit file
* An ipf attitude file
* The orient library from core
* Rotating frames
* ...the are more and more onthe way


Once you have the frame you can use the frames interface to evaluate the state and time derivatives up to jerk (order 3) 
and partial derivatives of translations and rotations of between any connected combination of Axes and Points.

To use the frame system in a class or function it is necessary to pass a pointer to the frames and the points and/or axes 
you want to use. The latter information can be in the form of names or Ids objects, which are typically used for efficiency.

.. code:: cpp

    linalg::Vector6 myFunction( frames::FramesPtr f, frames::PointId p1, frames::PointId p2, frames::AxesId ax, tempo::Epoch& epoch)
    {
        return f->vector< 1 >( p1, p2, ax , epoch );
    }

    linalg::Vector6 myFunction( frames::FramesPtr f, std::string p1, std::string p2, std::string ax, tempo::Epoch& epoch)
    {
        return f->vector< 1 >( f.pointId(p1), f.pointId(p2), f.axesId(ax), epoch );
    }

These two elements form the basis for understanding the model layer. Everything is based on this.

Propagator
==========

It is worth looking at the propagator, it is such an important part of the system although it applies the above design 
ideas rather than being an design idea in itself.

The propagator allows you to solve the equations of motion for a spacecraft on its own, or a set of spacecraft, or the 
Galilean moons, or a spinning comet with gravity torques, or the coupled orbit attitude motion of a piece of space debris, 
or the mass or radiation dose accumulated by a spacecraft.

As a user you have to prepare a :py:class:`godot.model.prop.InputVector` made up of :py:class:`godot.model.prop.ScalarInput`, :py:class:`godot.model.prop.PointInput`  
:py:class:`godot.model.prop.AxesInput` and :py:class:`godot.model.prop.VectorInput` objects.

Each of these inputs is constructed from various inputs including a right hand side (of the ODE you are solving) a time evaluable for 
the initial value of the thing you are propagating, and a thing for getting the result, e.g. you can specify the frame system Point or
Axes or a time evaluable for the propagated mass.

Each type of input expects a certain type of TimeEvaluable right hand side, a PointInput requires a Vector3TimeEvaluable, a ScalarInput 
requires a ScalarTimeEvaluable etc. The creation of the TimeEvaluables, how they are coupled with each other, how they combine other
inputs and handle discontinuities is your business.

The  right hand side (of the ODE you are solving) can contain Events which can force stops to the integration in the event of 
model discontinuities, e.g. eclipses, manoeuvre starts etc. Each event is made up of a trigger, which determines when the event 
occurs and an action to be taken when the trigger is fired. THe Events have to be registered with the propagator before the 
propagation starts.

The propagator inserts the resulting state or orientation into the frames system as a Point or Axes. 

In the examples in the documentation there are quite a few interesting and fun examples of implementing propagations which complex and simple models.

The Cosmos layer
----------------

Now that we fully grasp the concepts in the modelling layer we can move to the cosmos layer. Here is where the 
implementation of the core and model layers is performed into a system for solving astrodynamics problems.

We have talked about automatic differentiation and computing partial derivatives, but we have not defined 
parameters until now. How can that be?

A Parameter is a ScalarTimeEvaluable class which is therefore usable in the model layer. When you construct a Parameter
you attach a unique Leaf to it. Think of the models connected to each other in a tree structure. The parameters are the 
final points along the branches of that tree, the Leaf is a class which allows the parameters to be identified.

The autodif library in core handles the computation of things which have partial derivatives, or gradients. The gradients
are actually labelled and tracked in the computations by Leafs and therefore the gradient elements are also attributed 
uniquely to Parameters via the Leaf.

Having said that, normally the users shouldn’t need to worry about Leafs because the parameters are usually identified by
a name as well. The Parameters are all stored in a ParameterBook, as long as the ParameterBook is used, the names of the 
Parameters are also unique, so there is no problem.

So, now we can pass parameters to any model which accepts a TimeEvaluable as input. We can also decide to track or not a 
partial derivative element using the Parameter class.

Now we can imagine the modelling with parameters. The Parameters are all stored in a ParameterBook.

Next we can talk about Universes.

Universe
========

Until now  we have talked about diverse models. When we build an application it is useful to collect these into one place,
and provide the user with the means to construct, collect and evaluate these models. The Universe class is how this is 
done in cosmos.

You create a universe using a configuration file, this file will direct the software to build frames, dynamic models, parameters
and all sorts of other things based on your input.

The universe is made up of many plugin classes. Each is responsible for adding a certain collection of models to the universe.

In the :ref:`cosmos guide <cosmos_ug>` a description of the universe and a detailed definition of the configuration file needed
to create one is given. The way the application software usually works is based on a universe. Then you can have access to pretty 
much everything you might ever need.

Trajectory
==========

The trajectory class is also described in detail in the :ref:`cosmos guide <cosmos_ug>`.

This class, like the universe, is created using a configuration file. The trajectory contains one or more propagations. The class handles
the complexities of constructing the propagations for you. It also creates parameters based on you inputs for use in orbit determination or 
optimisation applications.
