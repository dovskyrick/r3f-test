# July Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the development goals for July 2024, focusing on enhancing the satellite visualization and management capabilities of our React Three Fiber application. The goals are structured into achievable milestones while maintaining ambitious targets for improvement.

## Week 1: Multiple Satellite Enhancement (July 1-7)
### Priority: High
- [ ] Implement satellite color differentiation system
  - Add color picker in satellite creation modal
  - Store color preferences in satellite context
  - Apply colors consistently across all views (3D, Map, Timeline)
- [ ] Enhance satellite list management
  - Add grouping capabilities for satellites
  - Implement drag-and-drop reordering
  - Add quick visibility toggles

## Week 2: Advanced Trajectory Visualization (July 8-14)
### Priority: High
- [ ] Implement trajectory segmentation
  - Add visual indicators for orbit segments (ascending/descending nodes)
  - Implement color gradients for altitude visualization
  - Add hover tooltips with orbital parameters
- [ ] Enhance timeline integration
  - Add multi-satellite timeline support
  - Implement satellite event markers (eclipses, station passes)
  - Add zoom levels for different time scales

## Week 3: Ground Station Integration (July 15-21)
### Priority: Medium
- [ ] Implement ground station visualization
  - Add ground station markers on both 2D and 3D views
  - Visualize coverage areas
  - Show line-of-sight indicators
- [ ] Add ground station management
  - Create ground station creation/edit modal
  - Implement station visibility filters
  - Add station pass prediction indicators

## Week 4: Performance Optimization & UX Improvements (July 22-31)
### Priority: Medium
- [ ] Optimize rendering performance
  - Implement trajectory point decimation based on zoom level
  - Add level-of-detail for Earth texture and models
  - Optimize React Three Fiber scene graph
- [ ] Enhance user experience
  - Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
  - Implement better loading indicators
  - Add tutorial overlays for new users

## Stretch Goals
### Priority: Low
- [ ] Implement orbit perturbation visualization
  - Show orbital decay predictions
  - Visualize atmospheric drag effects
- [ ] Add satellite conjunction detection
  - Implement basic collision prediction
  - Add visual warnings for close approaches
- [ ] Create data export capabilities
  - Add CSV/JSON export for trajectory data
  - Implement report generation for satellite passes

## Technical Debt & Maintenance
### Priority: Ongoing
- [ ] Improve error handling
  - Implement better error boundaries
  - Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- [ ] Enhance testing coverage
  - Add unit tests for new components
  - Implement integration tests for critical paths
- [ ] Documentation updates
  - Keep component documentation up to date
  - Add usage examples for new features

## Notes
- This roadmap is flexible and can be adjusted based on emerging priorities
- Each week's goals are independent and can be reordered if needed
- Focus is on delivering user-visible improvements while maintaining code quality
- Performance and user experience remain key considerations throughout

## Success Metrics
- Successful implementation of multiple satellite management
- Improved visualization performance with multiple trajectories
- Positive user feedback on new features
- Maintained or improved code test coverage
- Updated documentation for all new features
