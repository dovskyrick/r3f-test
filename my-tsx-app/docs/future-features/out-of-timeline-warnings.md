# Future Enhancements for Out-of-Timeline Markers

Potential improvements for satellite markers when they're outside the trajectory time range:

1. Add a visual pulse effect to out-of-range markers
2. Make the trajectory lines themselves more transparent when outside the time range
3. Add tooltips or other indicators to explain why the marker is transparent
