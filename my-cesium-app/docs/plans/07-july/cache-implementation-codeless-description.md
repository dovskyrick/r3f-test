# Cache System Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the development of a browser-based cache system for our 3D Earth visualization application. The cache will preserve user session state and satellite configuration data to provide continuity when users reload the application, while maintaining data freshness by re-fetching trajectory calculations from the server.

## Current System Context

Our application currently operates as a session-based system where:
- Users add satellites by inputting TLE data which is sent to the server for trajectory calculation
- All satellite configurations (names, colors, visibility settings) are lost when the page is refreshed
- Timeline position and zoom settings reset to defaults on each reload
- Users must manually re-add all satellites and reconfigure settings after any browser refresh

This creates a poor user experience, especially during development testing or accidental page refreshes.

## Proposed Feature: Persistent Cache System

### Core Functionality

The cache system will enable:

1. **Session Continuity** - preserve user work across browser refreshes and sessions
2. **Selective Data Persistence** - save configuration data while allowing fresh trajectory calculations
3. **State Restoration** - automatically restore the application to the user's previous working state
4. **Settings Preservation** - maintain user preferences and customizations

### User Experience Flow

**Step 1: Automatic State Saving**
As users work with the application, the system continuously saves their current state to browser storage without any user intervention.

**Step 2: Page Reload Recovery**
When users refresh the page or restart their browser, the application automatically detects saved cache data and begins restoration process.

**Step 3: Intelligent Data Restoration**
The system restores the user interface state and re-requests fresh trajectory data from the server using the cached satellite information, ensuring data accuracy while preserving user configuration.

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Decision: Browser Storage Strategy

The system will use **browser local storage** for persistent data retention combined with **selective caching** that distinguishes between configuration data (cached) and calculated data (server-refreshed).

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Cache Structure Design**
- Design the data structure for storing satellite metadata and user preferences
- Create a flexible schema that can accommodate future extensions like time interval specifications
- Implement cache versioning to handle future data structure changes

**Phase 2: State Capture System**
- Implement automatic saving of satellite TLE data and associated names
- Capture current timeline position and slider settings
- Save user customizations including satellite colors and visibility states
- Record application view state and focus mode selections

**Phase 3: Data Restoration Logic**
- Create system to detect and validate cached data on application startup
- Implement selective restoration that applies cached settings while requesting fresh trajectory calculations
- Develop fallback mechanisms for handling corrupted or outdated cache data

**Phase 4: Server Communication Integration**
- Modify the satellite loading system to work with both new TLE inputs and cached TLE restoration
- Ensure the server request system can handle bulk satellite restoration efficiently
- Implement proper error handling for cases where cached satellites cannot be restored

**Phase 5: Cache Management and Optimization**
- Implement cache size limits and cleanup mechanisms to prevent excessive browser storage usage
- Add cache invalidation strategies for handling data conflicts or corruption
- Create user controls for cache management including manual clear options

## Cache Storage Categories

### Persistent Configuration Data
**Satellite Metadata**: TLE line data, satellite names, assigned colors, visibility settings
**Timeline State**: Current time position, slider range settings, playback speed
**User Interface State**: Current view mode, focused satellite selection, zoom level
**Application Settings**: User preferences and customization options

### Excluded from Cache
**trajectory Calculations**: Raw trajectory point data will always be requested fresh from server
**Temporary UI State**: Loading indicators, error messages, transient user interface elements
**Session-Specific Data**: Temporary variables and runtime-only application state

## Future Extension Capabilities

The cache system is designed with extensibility in mind to support:

**Time Interval Tracking**: Recording specific time ranges requested for each satellite trajectory
**Mission Parameters**: Storing satellite-specific mission data and orbital parameters
**User Workspace**: Supporting multiple saved workspace configurations
**Collaboration Features**: Enabling shared satellite configurations between users
**Export/Import**: Allowing users to backup and restore their satellite collections
