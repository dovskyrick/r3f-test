# Satellite Context Menu Development Plan

## Project Overview

This document outlines the development of a right-click context menu system for satellite management in our 3D Earth visualization application. The feature provides users with quick access to satellite-specific actions through an intuitive right-click interface.

## Current System Context

Our application currently manages satellites through a sidebar list where users can:
- Toggle satellite visibility using an eye icon button
- Click to focus on satellites (as part of the focus mode feature)

Currently, there is no user interface for removing satellites once they have been added to the system.

## Proposed Feature: Right-Click Context Menu

### Core Functionality

The context menu system will enable users to:

1. **Right-click any satellite** in the satellite management list to open a context menu
2. **Access satellite actions** through a clean, organized menu interface
3. **Delete satellites** - implementing satellite removal functionality for the first time
4. **Open satellite settings** for future configuration options

### User Experience Flow

**Step 1: Context Menu Activation**
Users right-click on any satellite entry in the sidebar list. A small context menu appears near the cursor position with available actions.

**Step 2: Action Selection**
The context menu displays two options:
- "Delete Satellite" - removes the satellite from the list
- "Satellite Settings" - opens a settings interface for that specific satellite

**Step 3: Action Execution**
Users click on their desired action. The menu disappears and the selected action is performed immediately.

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Decision: Menu System Design

The system will use a **position-aware context menu** that appears at the cursor location when right-clicking. The menu will be satellite-specific, meaning each menu instance knows which satellite it belongs to.

### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Context Menu Component**
- Create a reusable context menu component that can appear at any screen position
- Implement menu positioning logic to ensure the menu stays within screen boundaries
- Add menu styling with proper visual hierarchy and hover effects

**Phase 2: Right-Click Detection**
- Modify the satellite list items to detect right-click events
- Prevent the browser's default right-click menu from appearing
- Calculate the appropriate position for the custom context menu
- Ensure the menu appears smoothly without interfering with left-click focus functionality

**Phase 3: Menu Actions Implementation**
- Implement the "Delete Satellite" action by creating new satellite removal functionality
- Create a placeholder "Satellite Settings" action that shows preparation for future features
- Ensure proper cleanup when actions are performed (menu disappears, state updates correctly)

**Phase 4: User Interface Integration**
- Integrate the context menu system with the existing satellite list interface
- Ensure the menu works consistently across different screen sizes and resolutions
- Add visual feedback to show users that right-clicking is available

**Phase 5: Testing and Refinement**
- Test context menu positioning in various scenarios (near screen edges, different zoom levels)
- Verify that all existing satellite management functionality continues to work properly
- Ensure the context menu doesn't interfere with other user interface elements
